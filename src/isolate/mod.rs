//! Extrasafe's `Isolate` allows you to run a subprocess in a [user
//! namespace](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html), which allows you to
//! isolate your program in order to e.g. run 
//!
//! Specifically, you can isolate:
//! - The filesystem. The Isolate creates a temporary directory and mounts a tmpfs onto it, and
//! then makes that tmpfs the new root. The original root filesystem becomes unaccessible.
//! Specific directories and files may be mounted into the tmpfs if desired.
//! - The network. A new network namespace may also be created. In the context of extrasafe, this
//! is mostly useful to disable the network and make it simpler to use seccomp.
//! - The program itself. In addition to running in a different memory space, so the original
//! program's data is unaffected by the subprocess, the Isolate is executed via an in-memory
//! copy of the program so that the program binary itself cannot be modified.

// options:
// - keep network
// - env vars
// - program name for ps (it's a prctl or something to set)
// - args identifier to catch we're in an isolate in main
// - bind mount directory list
// - tmpfs size?
