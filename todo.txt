# Nice to haves

- more builtin profiles
	take inspiration from pledge promises (https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2)
	and systemd profiles https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/src/shared/seccomp-util.h
		https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/3989bdc1ad7cca4d75c06cdf601fea2cb37ba337/src/shared/seccomp-util.c#L285
	see also old rkt allowlist https://github.com/rkt/rkt/blob/master/stage1/init/common/seccomp_wildcards.go

- benchmarks
  - only allow fs access and run ripgrep, compare vs without
  - only allow network access and run warp or actix server
  - more complicated example involving server thread + fs writer thread vs no separation?
  - *just re-use existing libraries' benchmarks and add extrasafe calls*
  - make sure we're using a separate benchmark profile/cfg so that those dependencies aren't pulled in to ci

- script (maybe already exists in libseccomp or systemd or firejail etc.) or extrasafe "util" API that you can run your tests with and it prints out the syscalls used
  - could even match against built-in profiles and make suggestions

- ctx.run(|| func)
  rather than loading into the current thread, start a new thread and load the context just into that thread
- extrasafe! macro
  sugar over run() + get return value over channel
  need to determine what syscalls crossbeam channels need (if any) vs flume (if any) (std mpsc is going to be deprecated)
  - feature flag for macro with return value over channel

# Multiplatform
bsd: pledge
osx: Seatbelt (`sandboxd`), see gaol below
windows: ProcessSystemCallDisablePolicy?, see chrome

see
https://github.com/servo/gaol/
and chrome?

# New functionality
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/docs/linux/sandboxing.md#User-namespaces-sandbox

User namespaces option? Something like:

rust
```
SafetyContext::new()
.isolate_process()
``` 

# Remove all dependencies
If you're using extrasafe to provide extra security, it then becomes a target for vulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks.

### this-error
Relatively easy to remove: just generate the code from the proc macros and commit it directly to the repository.

### libseccomp
This is the hardest part to remove as we'd have to either rewrite the bpf generator, or record the output of libseccomp for our specific use-cases and commit it to the repository. For cases like allowing lists of fds to be read from/written to, we'd have to do some additional work to template the generated bpf code, which is essentially what libseccomp is already doing.

There are actually two levels of dependencies here: [The Rust bindings](https://github.com/libseccomp-rs/libseccomp-rs) and [the actual C library](https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp)

maybe use the code from gaol?
https://github.com/servo/gaol/
https://github.com/servo/gaol/blob/4544946c5c922ee619a932ae5c3fd1d26f143384/platform/linux/seccomp.rs#L217

also can consider seccompiler, which at least brings the code into pure rust
and possibly gives us more flexibility on filtering syscall arguments, which is
a weakness of libseccomp
https://crates.io/crates/seccompiler

### syscalls
Relatively easy to remove by copying directly into the repository, but comes with a maintenance burden of having to update the lists when new syscalls are created.
