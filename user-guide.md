# How to use extrasafe

See [the corresponding example in the source code](https://github.com/boustrophedon/extrasafe/blob/master/examples/user-guide.rs) for an executable version of this guide's code.

Create a `SafetyContext`:

```rust
let ctx = extrasafe::SafetyContext::new();
```

Enable some `RuleSet`s, which are essentially named collections of syscalls grouped by functionality:

```rust
use extrasafe::builtins::{SystemIO, Networking};

let ctx = ctx
	.enable(
		SystemIO::nothing()
			.allow_open_readonly()
		).expect("Failed to add systemio ruleset to context")
		// The Networking RuleSet includes both read and write, but our files
		// will be opened readonly so we can't actually write to them.
		// We can still write to stdout and stderr though.
	.enable(
		Networking::nothing()
			.allow_start_tcp_clients()
			.allow_running_tcp_clients()
		).expect("Failed to add networking ruleset to context");
```

And then finally apply the rules to the current thread, or all threads, with `apply_to_current_thread` or `apply_to_all_threads`.

```rust
ctx.apply_to_current_thread()
	.expect("Failed to apply seccomp filters");
```

now trying to create a file for writing will fail:

```rust
assert!(std::fs::File::create("/tmp/a_file").is_err());
```

See the [examples directory](https://github.com/boustrophedon/extrasafe/tree/master/examples) and the [tests](https://github.com/boustrophedon/extrasafe/tree/master/examples) for more examples of how to use extrasafe with the built-in and custom rulesets.

## More on RuleSets

The `RuleSet` trait is defined as follows:

```rust
/// A [`RuleSet`] is a collection of [`SeccompRule`] s that enable a
/// functionality, such as opening files or starting threads.
pub trait RuleSet {
    /// A simple rule is one that just allows the syscall without restriction.
    fn simple_rules(&self) -> Vec<syscalls::Sysno>;

    /// A conditional rule is a rule that uses a condition to restrict the syscall, e.g. only
    /// specific flags as parameters.
    fn conditional_rules(&self) -> HashMap<syscalls::Sysno, Vec<SeccompRule>>;

    /// The name of the profile.
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
}

```

The RuleSet is comprised of
- A list of "simple rules", which enables the syscall without restriction
- A map of syscalls to a list of "Rules", which are pairs of a syscall and conditions on its arguments.
- The name of the RuleSet, for error message reporting purposes

There are a few restrictions to note about `RuleSet`s that originate in seccomp:

### Overlapping rules
Extrasafe starts from a default-deny state, and each time you `enable` a RuleSet, the SafetyContext gathers all the rules and adds them to its context (hence the name). Because we can only enable (i.e. the process is additive), enabling will fail if one `RuleSet` enables a syscall without restriction (via `simple_rules`), and another enables a syscall with a restriction (via `conditional_rules`). If it did not, the restriction would be silently ignored by seccomp when the filter is instantiated, which can be confusing.

One thing this impacts is where syscalls are used in multiple contexts, particularly the `read` and `write` syscalls: If you restrict the fds you can call `read` on, intending to limit access to the filesystem, you may also intentionally block yourself from `read`ing from a socket.

In order to get around this issue, you can do all your filesystem operations on one thread/process and your network operations in another, and communicate via e.g. a unix domain socket. See [examples/ipc\_server\_with\_database.rs](https://github.com/boustrophedon/extrasafe/blob/master/examples/ipc_server_with_database.rs) for an example of using communicating processes to achieve this separation. 


### Syscall pointer arguments

Seccomp, the underlying functionality provided by the kernel that extrasafe uses, doesn't allow comparisons on arguments that are pointers, so for example we can't filter on file path for `open` syscalls because the path is a `char *`.

## Defining your own ruleset

If you want to use syscalls that aren't included in any of the builtin rulesets, consider [filing an issue to request a new one!](https://github.com/boustrophedon/extrasafe/issues)

In the meantime, you can create your own:

```rust
use extrasafe::{SeccompRule, RuleSet};
use libseccomp::scmp_cmp;
use syscalls::Sysno;

use std::collections::HashMap;

struct MyRuleSet;

impl RuleSet for MyRuleSet {
	fn simple_rules(&self) -> Vec<Sysno> {
		// literally reboot the computer
		vec![Sysno::reboot]
	}

	fn conditional_rules(&self) -> HashMap<Sysno, Vec<SeccompRule>> {
		// Only allow the creation of stream (tcp) sockets
		const SOCK_STREAM: u64 = libc::SOCK_STREAM as u64;

		let rule = SeccompRule::new(Sysno::socket)
			.and_condition(
				scmp_cmp!($arg0 & SOCK_STREAM == SOCK_STREAM));
		HashMap::from([
			(Sysno::socket, vec![rule,])
		])
	}

	fn name(&self) -> &'static str {
		"MyRuleSet"
	}
}

// And it can be enabled just like the builtin ones:
extrasafe::SafetyContext::new()
	.enable(MyRuleSet).unwrap()
	.apply_to_current_thread().unwrap();
```

See the [libseccomp rust bindings documentation](https://docs.rs/libseccomp/latest/libseccomp/macro.scmp_cmp.html) for more information on how to use the comparator generator macro.

Currently [the syscalls crate's](https://crates.io/crates/syscalls) [`Sysno` enum](https://docs.rs/syscalls/latest/syscalls/enum.Sysno.html) is used in the `RuleSet` interface. It's convenient because the enum is defined separately for each target architecture such that the syscall gets mapped to the correct syscall number (which may differ on different architectures).

However, there are some syscalls that only exist on certain architectures (e.g. fstatat64 vs newfstatat). Currently the builtin RuleSets are defined assuming `x86_64`.
